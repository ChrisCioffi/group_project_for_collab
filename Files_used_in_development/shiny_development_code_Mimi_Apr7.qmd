Here's all the code needed to run the app so far - you can hit the play button to simulate a shiny environment - this can be where you start taking the names of states and turn it into maps

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(keyring)
library(httr2)
library(jsonlite)
library(plotly)
library(DT)

#ONE THING YOU HAVE TO DO TO MAKE THIS RUN - get an FEC api key and save it by un-noting this out and adding it 
#you can sign up for a key here - https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/ 
key_set("fec_api_key")

################## FUNCTION 1 ################

# fetch_candidate_ids - finds the person (or people) running for Senate in a given state and returns a dataframe with information about their candidacy, like party, state, and total raised from small donors (under \$200) and itemized donors (more than \$200). this is important because only the itemized information is included in the state-level data, so we can create a separate graph that shows the discrepancy between the itemized and unitemized

fetch_candidate_ids <- function(state_abbreviations) {

  return(list_candidates) ## Corrected: Moved this line to ensure saving and loading happens first
