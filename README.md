# Senate Race FEC Helper  

Purpose: A Shiny app that queries the FEC API in order to obtain donor information about Senate candidates running in states that have a Senate election in 2026.   
The app was created as a class project for DATA-613 at American University.
The app produces donor and candidate stats about the state(s) selected by users by querying the FEC API. To run the app, users must have an API key from the FEC website. You can find more instructions on how to obtain the key here - https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/

Once you have obtained a key, go to the app.r file and follow the instructions below the libraries to add it to your environment using library(keyring).
