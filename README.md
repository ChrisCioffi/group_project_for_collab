# Group Project Template
This template is for the group projects to use as a basis for their shiny app.

Instructions for the project are under the vignette folder and on Canvas.


2.9 Create a README File for Your Repo
Summarize the title and purpose of the App.
Identify the group members by name and GitHub ID.
If your repo requires acquiring or using API keys, include a link to the instructions for obtaining such keys.
Describe the license for the app. Consider Creative Commons.


- Groups should rename the top level folder for their app and change the structure as best fits their app.
- Be sure to delete the dummy files that are there to ensure the repo folders appear in the template.
