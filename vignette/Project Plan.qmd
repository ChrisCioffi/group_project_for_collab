App Title: Political Donor Insights

Group Members: Mimi Beckemeier, Chris Cioffi, Emily Eames, Youssouf Barry

## Topic and Data

Political donations influence elections, but voters lack transparency into where funds originate. Our Shiny app will visualize geographic trends in political donations for U.S. Senate races.

Proposed Data Sources:

-   FEC API (https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/)

-   U.S. Census (for district/state mapping support if needed)

## Status of Literature Review:

Preliminary review complete.

Studies show donor geography can affect candidate priorities and election outcomes.

Lack of interactive tools for voter use at state level (esp. Senate races).

## Use Case

Actors:

-   Primary user: U.S. voters hoping to get a better understanding of whether their candidate is raising money from their own neighbors and constituents, or if it's donors from out of state seeking to influence an election

-   Secondary users: Journalists, campaign transparency watchdogs

## Questions of Interest

Where are Senate candidates receiving donations from?

Are donations coming from within or outside the candidate's state?

How does donor concentration vary by party, geography, and time?

## Fixed or Dynamic Data

-   Dynamic -- pulled via FEC API based on user input (e.g., race, state, year)

## App Concept

Create radio buttons for each state that has a senate election in 2026

Depending on which button is pushed, create a function that queries the api for the candidates in that state, aggregates all contributions by state, adn then creates a map of those contributions for each candidate

Also creates a bar chart showing intemized and unitemized contributions along with total raised.

Create a statistical test and summary of average contribution - and the states that had the most donations - that compares the amount a candidate raised from their home state versus contributions raised out of state.

General Layout:

-   Sidebar panel: user input ( state )

-   Main panel: output visualizations (map, bar chart, summary stats)

User Data Manipulation Options:

-   Filter by year, state, candidate, and party

-   View donations by zip code, donor name (if public), or amount brackets

Numerical/Graphical Analysis Options:

-   Map showing donor density by ZIP or state

-   Bar plot of donation totals by location or party

-   Summary statistics of average donation size

Proposed App Theme:

-   Clean, professional theme using \`{bslib}\` or \`{shinythemes}\` or potential patriotic theme

Statistical Models/Tests:

-   Potential linear model: in-state vs out-of-state donation impact

-   Summary regression to show donor concentration vs vote share (optional advanced feature)

Advanced Features:

-   Time slider to show change in donations over the election cycle

-   Downloadable .csv summary of donation records per user filter

## Ethical Review

Ethics Discussion:

-   All FEC data is public, but care will be taken not to misuse personal data

-   No amplification of individual donor names unnecessarily

-   App will include a disclaimer about data sources and use

## Responsibilities

-   Chris: API integration and data wrangling

-   Mimi: Mapping and plotting logic

-   Emily: UI design and interactivity

-   Youssouf: Ethical review, documentation, and testing

## Collaboration

GitHub branching strategy:

-   Main branch + individual feature branches

-   Shared Quarto documentation for reproducibility

**Still trying to figure out GitHub repo situation for the project, have emailed Prof**

\## Plan.9 Schedule

-   Week 1: Data exploration, API test pulls, set up repo

-   Week 2: App layout, mapping prototype

-   Week 3: Filter functionality, plotting logic

-   Week 4: Final features, polishing, ethical review

-   Week 5: Writeup, vignette, documentation

## Overall

Formatting:

-   Follows R Markdown + Quarto structure

-   All code chunks named and annotated

Citations:

-   FEC API documentation, related political science papers

Spelling and Grammar:

-   Final check using spellchecker + peer review
