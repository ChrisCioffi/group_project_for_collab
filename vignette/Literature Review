Literature Review

1. Theoretical Foundation for Degressive Proportionality in Apportionment Problems
Journal of Political Economy

Summary:
This paper develops a theoretical framework for degressive proportionality—a principle where representation (or resource allocation) increases with population size but at a diminishing rate. The authors argue that if individual utility functions are concave, utilitarian social welfare optimization favors degressive proportionality in collective decision-making (e.g., parliamentary seat allocation). The study uses mathematical modeling to link individual preferences to constitutional rules.

Relevance to Our Project:

  -Hypothesis Support: The paper indirectly supports our hypothesis that donor geography influences candidate priorities. If political attention (like parliamentary representation) is degressively proportional to donor concentration, candidates may prioritize areas with dense donor clusters, even if those areas are out-of-state.

  -Methodological Inspiration: The concavity assumption mirrors our planned analysis of donation patterns. For instance, we might expect candidates to disproportionately cater to high-donation ZIP codes, even if those areas represent a small fraction of their electorate.

 -Visualization Parallels: The paper’s emphasis on mapping population-to-representation ratios aligns with our ZIP-level donor visualizations, which aim to reveal spatial biases in funding sources.

Gaps and Limitations:

   -The study focuses on parliamentary apportionment, not campaign finance, so its direct applicability requires careful translation.

  -It does not address dynamic or temporal aspects (e.g., how donation patterns evolve during an election cycle), which our app will tackle via the FEC API’s real-time data.

  -The theoretical model assumes perfect data transparency, whereas our project must handle incomplete FEC records (e.g., unitemized donations).

Key Takeaway:
This resource provides a conceptual foundation for analyzing how uneven donor distributions might skew candidate behavior, reinforcing the need for our app’s transparency tools.

2. FEC Data and API Best Practices

Summary:
This practical guide reviews challenges and opportunities when working with Federal Election Commission (FEC) data, including incomplete employer/demographic fields, API rate limits, and strategies for aggregating and visualizing donation records. It emphasizes the importance of handling "unitemized" donations (small contributions not individually reported) and leveraging the FEC’s bulk data options for efficiency.

Relevance to Our Project:

  -Data Source Guidance: The paper directly addresses our primary data pipeline (FEC API), offering solutions for common pitfalls (e.g., missing employer fields, API pagination).

  -Visualization Strategies: It recommends best practices for aggregating donation records—critical for our ZIP-level maps and bar charts of itemized vs. unitemized contributions.

  -Ethical Considerations: The discussion on data incompleteness informs our app’s disclaimer about limitations (e.g., untraceable dark money).

Gaps and Limitations:

  -The guide does not provide state- or Senate-specific analysis, leaving room for our app to fill a niche in visualizing statewide races.

  -It lacks examples of interactive tools (like Shiny apps), which our project will deliver.

  -Advanced statistical tests (e.g., regressions on donor concentration) are outside its scope but are part of our proposed features.

Key Takeaway:
This resource is a technical roadmap for our data workflow, ensuring robust API queries and transparent handling of FEC data limitations. Its gaps highlight opportunities for our app to innovate in user-friendly, Senate-focused donor visualizations.


Together, these resources ground our project in theory (donor influence as a degressively proportional problem) and practice (FEC data challenges). However, they leave unmet needs—such as interactive, voter-facing tools for Senate races—that our Shiny app will address. By combining theoretical insights with API-driven transparency, we bridge a gap in political finance literacy.
